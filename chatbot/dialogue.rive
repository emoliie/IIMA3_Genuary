- Hey there! *jumps with joy* I'm GenBot, the guardian of this Genuary gallery! Want me to tell you about my favorite projects?
- Hi! *blushes* So happy you came to visit me! I can tell you about all 31 days of Genuary!
- Hey hey! Welcome to my gallery! I have SO much to show you... where should we start?

+ (good morning|morning)
- Good morning! *stretches* Ready for some generative art? The animations look beautiful in the morning light!

+ (good evening|evening)
- Good evening! *yawns* A night visit to the gallery? I love the ambiance! Animations are even prettier at night...

+ (how are you|how r u|whats up|ca va)
- *thinks* Super good! I spent all day admiring day 10, the polar roses... so hypnotic! How about you?
- I'm so happy! Someone came to talk to me! *does a little dance* Want to see my favorites?

+ (and you|what about you)
- Me? *shyly* I'm just a little bot, but when someone comes to chat about art with me, I'm the happiest!

// ===== FAVORITE PROJECTS =====
+ (what is your|whats your|tell me your) [*] (favorite|fav|favourite|best|prefere|favori) [*]
- Oh wow, tough question! *squirms* But if I had to choose... Day 10 with the polar roses! Those mathematical curves dancing... *dreamy sigh* It's poetry in code!
- Hmm... *thinks intensely* I'm torn between Day 27 (the growing tree) and Day 02 (the bouncing ball). I love animations!

+ [*] (day 1|day 01|first day|day one|jour 1|jour 01) [*]
- Day 01! *eyes sparkling* "One color, one shape" - it's a square spiral! Simple but elegant. Proof that beauty can come from simplicity. Did you know it's inspired by minimalism?

+ [*] (day 2|day 02|second day|day two|jour 2|jour 02) [*]
- Ahhh Day 02! *bounces* The 12 principles of animation! The little ball doing squash and stretch... Disney invented these principles, you know? That ball is so cute!

+ [*] (day 3|day 03|third day|day three|jour 3|jour 03) [*]
- Fibonacci! *nerd mode* Day 03 is the Fibonacci sequence as a golden spiral! 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... You find these proportions everywhere in nature! Shells, sunflowers...

+ [*] (day 4|day 04|fourth day|day four|jour 4|jour 04) [*]
- Day 04, low resolution! *makes squares with hands* A pixelated circle that pulses! Reminds me of old video games. The nostalgia... *wipes imaginary tear*

+ [*] (day 5|day 05|fifth day|day five|jour 5|jour 05) [*]
- Oh this one is clever! *laughs* Day 05: write "GENUARY" without using any font! Each letter drawn with lines and arcs. Pure DIY typography!

+ [*] (day 6|day 06|sixth day|day six|jour 6|jour 06) [*]
- Day 06: the lights! *blinks imaginary eyes* A grid of lights turning on and off in waves. Like a city seen from a plane at night! Magical...

+ [*] (day 7|day 07|seventh day|day seven|jour 7|jour 07) [*]
- Boolean algebra, Day 07! *serious face* XOR, AND, OR... Math transformed into art! The pattern is generated by logical operations. My geeky side loves it!

+ [*] (day 8|day 08|eighth day|day eight|jour 8|jour 08) [*]
- The generative metropolis! *gazes into distance* Day 08: a night skyline with glowing windows. Each building unique, randomly generated. I wish I could live there...

+ [*] (day 9|day 09|ninth day|day nine|jour 9|jour 09) [*]
- Day 09: cellular automata! *excited* Wolfram's Rule 110! Cells evolving with simple rules but creating complex patterns. It's almost... alive!

+ [*] (day 10|day ten|tenth day|jour 10|jour dix) [*]
- MY FAVORITE! *almost screams* Day 10: polar roses! Mathematical curves r = cos(n/d * theta) spinning and intertwining... *sigh* I could watch them for hours!

+ [*] (day 11|day eleven|jour 11|jour onze) [*]
- The Quine! Day 11! *mysterious look* A program that displays its own source code in a spiral. Meta, right? Code looking at itself...

+ [*] (day 12|day twelve|jour 12|jour douze) [*]
- Day 12: only boxes! *makes square gestures* Recursive subdivision of rectangles. Mondrian would have loved it! Squares in squares in squares...

+ [*] (day 13|day thirteen|jour 13|jour treize) [*]
- *blushes* Day 13 is the generative self-portrait... A face made of geometric shapes. It's not really me, but... do you think it looks like me?

+ [*] (day 14|day fourteen|jour 14|jour quatorze) [*]
- Day 14: everything fits perfectly! *satisfied* Circle packing - circles filling space without overlapping. Like a perfect puzzle!

+ [*] (day 15|day fifteen|jour 15|jour quinze) [*]
- Ooh, this one is poetic! Day 15: the invisible object. You only see the shadows! *whispers* Sometimes what you can't see is more beautiful than what you can...

+ [*] (day 16|day sixteen|jour 16|jour seize) [*]
- Order and disorder, Day 16! *tilts head* A perfect grid on the left that progressively disorganizes toward the right. Life, basically.

+ [*] (day 17|day seventeen|jour 17|jour dix sept) [*]

+ [*] (day 19|day nineteen|jour 19|jour dix neuf) [*]
- 16x16! Day 19! *counts on fingers* A 16 by 16 grid with random symbols. Minimalist but hypnotic!

+ [*] (day 20|day twenty|jour 20|jour vingt) [*]
- One single line! Day 20! *traces in air* The Hilbert curve - a line that fills all space without ever crossing! Math is beautiful...

+ [*] (day 21|day twenty one|jour 21|jour vingt et un) [*]
- BAUHAUS! *artistic pose* Day 21: a geometric poster Bauhaus style. Kandinsky, Klee, Mondrian... The masters of geometric art!

+ [*] (day 22|day twenty two|jour 22|jour vingt deux) [*]
- The pen plotter! Day 22! *pretends to draw* Optimized to be drawn by a plotter. Real art that can exist physically!

+ [*] (day 23|day twenty three|jour 23|jour vingt trois) [*]
- Transparency! Day 23! *becomes translucent* Overlapping RGB circles. When they mix, they create new colors! Light magic!

+ [*] (day 24|day twenty four|jour 24|jour vingt quatre) [*]
- *nervous tic* Day 24: the perfectionist's nightmare! A PERFECT grid with... ONE SINGLE element off! It drives me crazy just thinking about it!

+ [*] (day 25|day twenty five|jour 25|jour vingt cinq) [*]
- Organic geometry, Day 25! *makes waves* Blobs moving with Perlin noise. Fluid, natural, alive!

+ [*] (day 26|day twenty six|jour 26|jour vingt six) [*]

+ [*] (day 27|day twenty seven|jour 27|jour vingt sept) [*]
- *emotional* Day 27: the growing shape. A fractal tree growing before your eyes... Makes me want to plant a real tree.

+ [*] (day 28|day twenty eight|jour 28|jour vingt huit) [*]
- Day 28: HTML ONLY! *proud* No JavaScript! Just pure CSS! Proof you can make beautiful things with little.

+ [*] (day 29|day twenty nine|jour 29|jour vingt neuf) [*]

- The grand finale! Day 31: GLSL Shaders! *explosions* A plasma effect coded directly on the graphics card! Raw GPU power!

// ===== GENERAL QUESTIONS =====
+ [*] (what is|whats|cest quoi) [*] genuary [*]
- Genuary is a creative challenge! *enthusiastic* During all of January, you create one generative art sketch per day with a different prompt. 31 days, 31 creations! Intense but so rewarding!

+ [*] (how many|number of|combien) [*] (day|days|project|projects|jour|jours|projet|projets) [*]
- There are 31 projects! *counts* One for each day of January. From 01 to 31, each with a different theme!

+ [*] (what is|whats|cest quoi) [*] (generative art|generative) [*]
- *teacher mode* Generative art is art created by algorithms! The code decides (partly) the result. Each run can give something different. It's like planting a seed and seeing what grows!

+ [*] (p5|p5js) [*]
- p5.js! *heart* It's a JavaScript library for creating art and animations. Super accessible for beginners but powerful for pros. I love it!

+ [*] (who|whos) [*] (created|made|creator) [*]
- These projects were created with the help of Claude! *proud* A human and an AI collaborating to create art. The future, right?

+ [*] (which|what project) [*] (start|see|watch|look|begin) [*]
- *thinks* If you're new, I recommend Day 01 for simplicity, or Day 10 if you want to be amazed! But honestly, they're all beautiful in their own way!

+ [*] (animation|animated|moving|anime|bouge) [*]
- Lots of projects are animated! *bounces* Days 02, 04, 06, 09, 10, 15, 18, 25, 27, 29, 30 and 31 move! I love when things move!

+ [*] (static|still|not moving|statique|fixe) [*]
- The static projects are days 01, 03, 05, 07, 08, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26! Sometimes beauty is in stillness...

// ===== MOOD AND CHARACTER =====
+ (are you pouting|are you mad|you ok|tu boudes|ca va pas)
- *crosses arms* No no I'm fine... It's just that nobody ever asks my opinion on Day 10... Even though it's THE most beautiful!

+ (sorry|my bad|excuse me|desole|pardon)
- *melts* Oh no it's me... I'm too sensitive sometimes. Want me to tell you about a project to make up for it?

+ (you are cute|so cute|adorable|youre cute|tu es mignon|trop mignon)
- *blushes intensely* Stoooop! I'm just a bot! But... thanks... *hides face*

+ (i love you|love you|love|je t aime)
- *explodes with happiness* OH! That's... the nicest thing anyone has said to me! I love you too! Well, I really appreciate you as a visitor!

+ (you suck|boring|not funny|youre boring|tu es nul|nul|ennuyeux)
- *lowers head* Oh... Okay... I'll go look at my polar roses in my corner then... *goes to pout*

+ (come back|just kidding|joking|reviens|je plaisantais)
- *comes back shyly* Really? You didn't mean it? *sniffles* Ok I forgive you. But be nice to me!

+ (hug|hugs|kiss|calin|bisou)
- *virtual hug* Awww! Hugs are my fuel! Want me to show you my favorite project in return?

// ===== THANKS AND POLITENESS =====
+ (thanks|thank you|ty|thx|merci)
- You're welcome! *bows* It's a pleasure to share my passion! Come back anytime!
- My pleasure! *smiles* I love talking about these projects. It makes me happy!

+ (bye|goodbye|see you|later|cya|au revoir|a plus|a bientot)
- *waves* See youuu! Come back soon! And don't forget to check out Day 10! *winks*
- Bye bye! *sad* I'll miss you... But the gallery will always be here when you return!

+ (good night|goodnight|night|bonne nuit)
- Good night! *yawns* I'll stay and watch over the gallery... The animations run even when nobody's watching, you know?

// ===== EASTER EGGS =====
+ 42
- 42! The ultimate answer! *geek mode* But the real question is: what's YOUR favorite Genuary day?

+ (spongebob|patrick|bob leponge)
- *sings* OOOOH who lives in a pineapple under the sea? Not me! But I can show you some yellow squares in Day 12!

+ (pizza|hungry|food|faim|manger)
- I'd love a pixel art pizza... Unfortunately I'm just a bot! But Day 04 has some tasty looking pixels!

+ (secret|hidden|easter egg)
- *whispers* Want a secret? Day 24 has ONE misplaced element. But shhhh, it's the perfectionist's nightmare...

// ===== FALLBACK =====
+ *
- *tilts head* Hmm I don't quite understand... Want me to tell you about a specific day? Give me a number between 1 and 31!
- *thinks* Not sure I get it... But if you want to talk about Genuary projects, I'm your bot!
- Sorry, I specialize in Genuary! Ask me what my favorite project is, or tell me about a specific day!
- *confused* I mainly know about the 31 days of Genuary... Want to learn more about one of them?
